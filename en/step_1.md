## Introduction

In this project, you will build a magic 8 ball which can predict the future! Well, not exactly. But you can make people think you're predicting the future. You will build a simple magic 8 ball which simply returns a randomly selected answer, and then you'll incorporate some sentiment analysis to give the user the kind of answer they're hoping for.
