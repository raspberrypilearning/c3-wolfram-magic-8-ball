## Introduction

In this project, you will create a Magic 8 Ball which can read minds! Well, not exactly. But you can make the user think that it is reading their mind. You will build a simple Magic 8 Ball which returns a randomly selected answer, and then you will add in some sentiment analysis to give the user the kind of answer they're hoping for.
